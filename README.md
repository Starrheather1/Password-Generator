## Description

The starter code has been modified to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they have selected. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by Javascript code that I wrote. The user can choose password based on length, uppercase and/or lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
